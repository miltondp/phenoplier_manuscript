### LVs reveal trait clusters with shared transcriptomic properties

**Cluster analysis on traits using the latent gene expression representation.**
**a)** The projection of TWAS results on 3,752 traits into the latent gene expression representation is the input data to the clustering process.
A linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP) dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the input data, and five different clustering algorithms processed all data versions.
These algorithms derive partitions from the data using different parameters (such as the number of clusters), leading to an ensemble of 4,428 partitions.
Then, a distance matrix is derived by counting how many times a pair of traits was grouped in different clusters across the ensemble.
Finally, a consensus function is applied to the distance matrix to generate consolidated partitions with different numbers of clusters (from 2 to $\sqrt{n}\approx$ 60).
These final solutions were represented in the clustering tree (Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
**b)** The clusters found by the consensus function were used as labels to train a decision tree classifier on the original input data, which detects the LVs that better differentiate groups of traits.

To identify groups of clusters linked by the same transcriptional processes, we utilized the projection of gene-trait associations into the latent space.
Recognizing that individual clustering algorithms have inherent biases due to their assumptions about data structure, we developed a consensus clustering framework that integrates solutions or partitions of traits generated by various methods ([Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
Consensus or ensemble approaches are recommended to mitigate pitfalls in cluster analysis of biological data [@doi:10.1126/scisignal.aad1932].
Emphasizing the importance of diversity in the ensemble, we created different data versions processed through different methods with varying parameter sets (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}a).
Subsequently, a consensus function amalgamated the ensemble into a unified solution, which typically outperforms any single ensemble member [@Strehl2002; @doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2005.113].
Our clustering pipeline produced 15 final consensus clustering solutions (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:agreement), with the number of clusters in these partitions ranging from 5 to 29, determined by selecting partitions with the highest agreement within the ensemble [@Strehl2002].
Rather than selecting a single final solution with a specific number of clusters, we employed a clustering tree [@doi:10.1093/gigascience/giy083] (Figure @fig:clustering:tree) to explore stable groups of traits across multiple resolutions.
To discern which latent variables differentiated the trait groups, we trained a decision tree classifier on the input data $\hat{\mathbf{M}}$ using the identified clusters as labels (Figure {@fig:clustering:design}b, see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
This approach effectively identified transcriptional processes linking the trait groups.

**Clustering tree using multiple resolutions for clusters of traits.**
Each row represents a partition/grouping of the traits, and each circle is a cluster from that partition.
The number of clusters goes from 5 to 29.
Arrows indicate how traits in one cluster move across clusters from different partitions.
Most of the clusters are preserved across different resolutions, showing highly stable solutions even with independent runs of the clustering algorithm.

To determine the clustering patterns of various phenotypes, we analyzed their grouping into distinct branches.
We found that the phenotypes were organized into five primary branches, as depicted in Figure @fig:clustering:tree.
These branches are: 0) a "large" branch containing the majority of traits, which begins to subdivide at $k$=16, including clusters for asthma, subjective well-being traits, and nutrient intake; 1) heel bone-densitometry measurements; 2) hematological assays on red blood cells; 3) physical measures such as spirometry, body impedance, and anthropometric traits with separate sub-branches for fat-free and fat mass measures; and 4) a "complex" branch encompassing keratometry measurements, assays on white blood cells and platelets, skin and hair color traits, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, which also includes related traits like hand-grip strength [@pmid:25982160] and environmental/behavioral factors such as physical activity and diet (refer to Supplementary Data 3-7 for comprehensive clustering results).
Within these branches, the clustering results remained relatively stable, with the same traits frequently grouped together at different resolutions.
Notably, arrows between clusters indicate that traits occasionally transition from one group to another, predominantly from the "complex" branch (4) and the "large" branch (0) to the "complex" branch.
This pattern is anticipated, as complex diseases are often linked to shared genetic and environmental factors, making them challenging to categorize into a single cluster.

To determine which latent variables (LVs) were driving the observed clusters of traits, we trained decision tree classifiers on the input data, using each cluster at $k$=29 (bottom of Figure @fig:clustering:tree) as labels (see [Methods](#sec:methods:clustering)).
This approach identified the top LVs that were most discriminative for each cluster.
Several of these LVs aligned well with known biological pathways (Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap), while others, though not previously documented, were expressed in relevant tissues (Figure @fig:sup:clustering:novel:heatmap).
For instance, Figure @fig:clustering:heatmap shows that some LVs were highly specific to certain traits, whereas others were linked to a broad range of phenotypes, suggesting roles in general biological functions.
Using our regression framework, we evaluated the significance of the association between these LVs and various traits.
Notably, LVs such as LV928 and LV30, which aligned with early erythrocyte progenitor pathways [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2011.01.004] (Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv928 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv30), were predominantly expressed during early erythropoiesis (Figures @fig:sup:lv928 and @fig:sup:lv30) and showed strong associations with red blood cell assays (FDR < 0.05; Tables @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv928, @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv928, and @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv30).
Conversely, other LVs demonstrated high specificity, such as LV730, which is expressed in thrombocytes from various cancer samples (Figure @fig:sup:lv730 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv730) and significantly associated with hematological assays on platelets (FDR < 0.05, Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv730), and LV598, whose genes were expressed in corneal endothelial cells (Figure @fig:sup:lv598 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv598) and correlated with keratometry measurements (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv598).
Thus, our analysis identified key LVs that are either broadly or specifically associated with particular biological traits and functions.


To determine whether specific latent variables (LVs) are associated with autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases, we examined the clustering of these disease sub-branches at $k=10$ (middle of Figure @fig:clustering:tree).
We focused on LV57 and LV844 to see if they influenced one or both disease types.
LV57, which is expressed in T cells (Figure @fig:sup:lv57 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv57), was the gene module most strongly linked to autoimmune disorders in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv57), with significant associations with hypothyroidism that were replicated in eMERGE (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv57).
Notably, LV57 was also associated with deep venous thrombosis in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE.
Conversely, LV844 showed a more specific association with autoimmune diseases such as polymyalgia rheumatica, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and celiac disease in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv844), although these associations were not replicated in eMERGE.
LV844 was expressed in a diverse range of cell types, including blood, breast organoids, myeloma cells, lung fibroblasts, and various brain cell types (Figure @fig:sup:lv844 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv844).
Thus, while LV57 is associated with both autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases, LV844 appears to be more specific to autoimmune conditions.


To investigate the associations between latent variables (LVs) and cardiovascular traits, we examined significant LV-trait associations in both PhenomeXcan and eMERGE datasets.
The cardiovascular sub-branch revealed 129 significant LV-trait associations in PhenomeXcan and 23 in eMERGE.
Specifically, LV136, which is associated with known collagen formation and muscle contraction pathways (Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv136), showed correlations with coronary artery disease and keratometry measurements in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv136) and with coronary atherosclerosis (phecode: 411.4) in eMERGE (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv136).
LV136 was expressed across various cell types, including fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, pancreatic stellate cells, cardiomyocytes, and adipocytes (Figure @fig:sup:lv136).
Furthermore, within the cardiovascular sub-branch, we identified associations with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and ADHD, which have previously been linked to the cardiovascular system [@pmid:12093424; @doi:10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.002065; @doi:10.1192/bjp.bp.117.202606; @doi:10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.118.313563].
These disorders share several risk factors, including hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking [@doi:10.1186/s12916-014-0206-2; @doi:10.1111/j.1076-7460.2007.06696.x].
Our results suggest that these diseases may be grouped by potentially shared transcriptional processes expressed in specific tissues/cell types.
For example, Alzheimer's disease, significantly associated with LV21 in PhenomeXcan (Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv21) but not present in eMERGE, was strongly expressed in various soft tissue sarcomas, monocytes/macrophages (including microglia from cortex samples), and aortic valves (Figure @fig:sup:lv21 and Table @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv21).
LV21 was also associated with lipids and high cholesterol in PhenomeXcan and hyperlipidemia (phecode: 272.1) in eMERGE (Table @tbl:sup:emerge_assocs:lv21).
This supports the role of macrophages in reverse cholesterol transport and atherogenesis [@doi:10.1093/qjmed/hci136], and highlights the importance of lipid metabolism in microglia for the development of neurodegenerative diseases [@doi:10.3389/fphys.2020.00393].
