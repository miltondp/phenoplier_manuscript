## Discussion

Our study presents a novel computational strategy that enhances the understanding of gene-trait associations by integrating Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) with gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across various cell types.
This innovative approach utilizes a latent representation that incorporates data not only from normal tissues but also from cells under different stimuli and developmental stages.
This method allows for a more nuanced interpretation of complex phenotypes, focusing on cell type-specific attributes rather than mere statistical correlations.
Our findings demonstrate the utility of this approach in identifying disease-relevant cell types using summary statistics, with successful replication of several disease-associated gene modules in the eMERGE network [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].
Additionally, through a CRISPR screen aimed at analyzing lipid regulation, our gene module-based strategy proved effective in prioritizing causal genes, even in scenarios where single gene associations failed to appear.
These results align with the omnigenic model, which differentiates between "core" and "peripheral" genes, suggesting our method's capability to pinpoint direct genetic influencers of traits without mediated regulation.
This approach not only sheds light on the intricate mechanisms underlying genetic associations but also opens avenues for identifying novel therapeutic targets that are potentially more effective due to their direct influence on disease phenotypes.


Our study enhances the understanding of drug-disease relationships through a novel gene module perspective, integrating drug-induced transcriptional profiles to map connections between diseases, drugs, and specific cell types.
This methodological advancement is evidenced by our results, where the latent variable (LV)-based drug-repurposing approach significantly surpassed traditional gene-based methods in accurately predicting drug-disease links for 322 drugs across 53 diseases.
Notably, we applied this approach to cardiovascular traits using niacin as a case study, demonstrating its capability to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological processes and mechanisms of action in diverse tissues such as adipose tissue, immune cells, and ovarian granulosa cells.
This LV-based strategy not only supports the statistical prediction of drug efficacy but also offers a robust framework for generating new hypotheses regarding the mechanisms and potential adverse effects of both known and experimental drugs.
This approach could pave the way for more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions in the future.


**Revised paragraph:**

Our study successfully utilized latent variable (LV) cluster analysis to discern meaningful associations between diseases and traits through shared and distinct transcriptional mechanisms in relevant tissues.
This method effectively identified specific LVs that were crucial for distinguishing between different clusters, and several of these LVs were significantly linked to various traits.
While some LVs aligned well with established biological pathways, others such as LV57 did not, potentially unveiling novel disease-related mechanisms.
Additionally, certain LVs seemed to correlate with specific cell types, suggesting that these markers could pinpoint the cell types directly involved in the manifestation of particular phenotypes.
For instance, LV246 predominantly expressed in adipose tissue and LV66 in ovarian tissue suggest tissue-specific expression patterns, whereas LV136, associated with cardiovascular traits and expressed across multiple cell types including fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes, illustrates a broader, possibly pleiotropic pathway involvement.
Other notable findings include LV844, which is expressed in whole blood and linked to autoimmune diseases, and LV57, associated with T cells and conditions like autoimmune diseases and venous thromboembolism, supporting the concept of "network pleiotropy" where similar cell types might underlie molecularly connected traits.
Our approach of projecting through a representation learned from diverse datasets represents, to our knowledge, a novel and computationally straightforward method to explore the impact of cell types and pathways on complex phenotypes, paving the way for future investigations into the molecular underpinnings of disease [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].


Revised paragraph:

In this study, we explored the utility of clustering trees, originally developed to analyze developmental stages in single-cell datasets, for categorizing phenotypes at multiple resolutions through associations with latent variables.
Employing hard-partitioning algorithms, we ensured that each trait was uniquely assigned to a cluster, considering the comprehensive gene module interactions.
Despite the robust methodology, the complexity of traits, such as in certain diseases, may lead to sharing only minimal biological processes, challenging the assumption of broad similarity.
Furthermore, our transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) results were derived from a diverse array of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), varying in sample size and quality.
Although we addressed these variations through meticulous preprocessing, the potential for residual bias remains a concern.
Previous research has indicated that analyzing groups of related diseases can enhance the detection of shared genetic foundations [@doi:10.1038/ng.3985; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0121-0].
Our application of clustering trees leverages this approach, offering a novel perspective on the interplay between genetic relationships and latent variables, and paving the way for future investigations into the genetic architecture of complex diseases.


Finally, our study introduces a novel LV-based regression framework designed to investigate associations between gene modules and traits using TWAS $p$-values.
Utilizing PhenomeXcan as a discovery cohort, we examined over four thousand traits, achieving significant findings that were largely replicated in the eMERGE cohort.
Specifically, in PhenomeXcan, we identified 3,450 significant LV-trait associations (FDR < 0.05) involving 686 LVs (out of 987), and 1,176 traits linked to at least one LV.
Similarly, in eMERGE, we documented 196 significant associations, with 116 LVs and 81 traits showing at least one significant link.
Despite our focus on select disease types within our trait clusters, a comprehensive dataset of associations across various disease domains is accessible for further exploration in our [Github repository](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier).
A noted limitation in our [Methods](#sec:methods:reg) section is the approximate accuracy of gene-gene correlations within our regression approach, which poses a risk of false positives if correlations among top genes in a module are imprecisely estimated.
Nevertheless, the regression model demonstrated approximate calibration without evident inflation in real data applications, suggesting robustness in our findings.
This framework opens avenues for future research to expand upon these associations and explore their implications in other disease contexts, potentially enhancing our understanding of genetic influences on diverse traits.


Our study leverages the assumption that gene modules exhibiting coordinated expression patterns are likely to have coordinated pathological impacts.
We employed two complementary methods: MultiPLIER and TWAS.
MultiPLIER, which relies on latent variables extracted from large expression datasets such as recount2, provides a robust framework for analyzing gene expressions.
However, recount2's model, primarily designed for rare disorders, may not be ideally suited for the diverse complex diseases in our study and might overlook complex co-expression patterns due to its reliance on linear variable combinations.
Furthermore, newer datasets have emerged that surpass recount2 in both size and scope [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1101/2021.05.21.445138].
Despite these limitations, our model's flexibility allows for easy replacement of MultiPLIER with advanced methods like GenomicSuperSignature [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31411-3].
On the other hand, TWAS focuses solely on the hypothesis that GWAS loci influence traits through gene expression changes, potentially overlooking other effects such as those from coding variants on protein interactions.
TWAS also faces challenges like false positives and the complexity of interpreting multiple genes within a locus, often due to shared GWAS variants or correlated gene expressions [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.012; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0092-1; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
Despite these issues, our LV-based regression framework effectively addresses gene-gene correlations in TWAS.
Moving forward, refining these methodologies or integrating newer, more robust datasets could enhance our understanding of gene expression's role in complex diseases, paving the way for more accurate genetic insights.


Our study aligns well with existing literature that indicates drugs supported by genetic evidence are more likely to advance successfully in the drug development process [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
Specifically, our approach of using latent variables to project association results has proven more effective in identifying viable disease-treatment pairs than methods focusing solely on single-gene effects.
This method not only enhances the prioritization process but also sheds light on interpretable genetic features, potentially unraveling mechanisms of action.
Despite these strengths, our approach faces challenges, particularly in selecting the most suitable tissue model from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) to discern reversed transcriptomic patterns between genes and drug-induced perturbations when dealing with diseases of diverse tissue etiologies.
This hurdle underscores the need for refined model selection techniques that could further bolster the predictive power of our methodology in diverse biological contexts.


Ultimately, the effectiveness of our analysis hinges on the quality of the data representations used.
In this study, we employed representations derived from a factorization of bulk RNA-seq data.
While this approach is robust, integrating more detailed perturbation datasets and single-cell profiling across various developmental stages could enhance the quality and interpretability of these representations.
Moreover, the ability to interpret these complex datasets often depends on the quality of the sample metadata annotations.
Recent advancements in metadata structuring and annotation techniques show promise for improving interpretability and can be readily applied to enhance existing datasets [@doi:10.1101/2021.05.10.443525].
The continual improvement in data representation and metadata annotation is paving the way for more effective use of latent variable projections.
These projections are crucial for unraveling the genetic underpinnings of complex human phenotypes.
Our methodology offers a fresh perspective on the mechanistic insights that can be derived from transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), fostering the generation of testable hypotheses for post-GWAS functional analyses of complex diseases.
This area is poised to become a focal point of significant research interest in the foreseeable future.
