## Discussion

### Revised Paragraph:

Our study presents a pioneering computational strategy that integrates Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) with gene modules exhibiting similar expression patterns across various cell types.
This innovation is particularly significant as it projects gene-trait associations through a latent representation derived from both normal and stimulated cell types at different developmental stages, enhancing the interpretation of cell type-specific features in complex phenotypes.
This methodology not only identifies disease-relevant cell types from summary statistics but also successfully replicates several disease-associated gene modules in the eMERGE network.
For instance, using a CRISPR screen to investigate lipid regulation, our gene module-based approach effectively prioritized causal genes even when individual gene associations were not apparent.
These findings align with the omnigenic model of "core" and "peripheral" genes, indicating that our approach can pinpoint genes that directly influence the trait without mediated regulation of other genes.
Consequently, this strategy offers a promising avenue for identifying alternative and potentially more effective therapeutic targets [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].


**Revised Paragraph:**

A notable strength of our study is the integration of drug-induced transcriptional profiles using a gene module perspective, which facilitated the connection between diseases, drugs, and cell types.
This integration revealed that our latent variable (LV)-based drug-repurposing approach significantly outperformed traditional gene-based methods in predicting drug-disease associations for 322 drugs across 53 diseases.
This finding aligns with previous research emphasizing the advantages of systems-level analyses over single-gene approaches [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433].
To further substantiate our results, we focused on cardiovascular traits and the drug niacin, demonstrating how our approach links pathophysiological processes with established mechanisms of action, particularly in adipose tissue, immune cells, and ovarian granulosa cells.
This underscores the potential of our LV-based method to generate novel hypotheses for evaluating the mechanisms of action or adverse effects of both known and experimental drugs.
Future research could expand on this by applying our approach to a broader range of diseases and drug classes, potentially revolutionizing drug repurposing strategies.


### Revised Paragraph

Our analysis of associations through latent representations effectively grouped diseases and traits based on shared and distinct transcriptional mechanisms in relevant tissues.
This cluster analysis identified latent variables (LVs) most discriminative for each cluster, with several LVs significantly associated with different traits.
While some LVs aligned with known pathways, others, such as LV57, did not, potentially indicating novel disease mechanisms.
Notably, some LVs linked to phenotypes were associated with specific cell types, revealing potentially causal cell types for certain phenotypes with greater precision.
For instance, we identified modules expressed predominantly in one tissue, like adipose in LV246 or ovary in LV66, while others were expressed across multiple contexts, capturing pathways linked to complex diseases.
An example is LV136, associated with cardiovascular disease and corneal biomechanics, expressed in fibroblasts, osteoblasts, pancreas, liver, and cardiomyocytes.
Similarly, LV844, expressed in whole blood, is linked to various autoimmune diseases, and LV57, expressed in T cells, is associated with autoimmune and venous thromboembolism.
These patterns may illustrate "network pleiotropy," where the same cell types mediate molecularly related traits.
Our novel approach of projecting through a representation learned on complementary but distinct datasets offers a computationally simple method to identify cell type and pathway effects on complex phenotypes, suggesting promising directions for future research.


### Revised Paragraph

One strength of our study is the demonstration that clustering trees, initially designed to examine developmental processes in single-cell data, can effectively group phenotypes at multiple resolutions based on latent variable associations.
We utilized hard-partitioning algorithms, where each trait is assigned to a single cluster, considering the distance between traits across all gene modules.
However, it is important to note that complex diseases might share only a few biological processes rather than being broadly similar.
Additionally, our TWAS results stemmed from a diverse set of GWAS with varying sample sizes and quality, which, despite thorough preprocessing, could introduce some bias.
Previous research has shown that grouping related diseases can enhance the detection of shared genetic etiology [@doi:10.1038/ng.3985; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0121-0].
Clustering trees offer a robust method to explore these relationships through the lens of latent variables, suggesting a promising direction for future research in understanding the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases.


### Revised Paragraph

A key strength of our study is the development of an LV-based regression framework designed to detect associations between gene modules and traits using TWAS $p$-values.
This approach was validated using PhenomeXcan as a discovery cohort, encompassing over four thousand traits, and many LV-trait associations were successfully replicated in eMERGE.
Specifically, in PhenomeXcan, we identified 3,450 significant LV-trait associations (FDR < 0.05), with 686 LVs (out of 987) linked to at least one trait and 1,176 traits associated with at least one LV.
In eMERGE, we found 196 significant LV-trait associations, with 116 LVs associated with at least one trait/phecode and 81 traits linked to at least one LV.
Although our analysis primarily focused on a few disease types from our trait clusters, the full set of associations across other disease domains is accessible in our [Github repository](https://github.com/greenelab/phenoplier) for further exploration.
One limitation, as noted in the Methods section [@sec:methods:reg], is the approximate accuracy of gene-gene correlations, which might lead to false positives if the correlations among the top genes in a module are not precisely captured.
Nonetheless, our regression model is approximately well-calibrated, and we did not observe any inflation when applying the method to real data.
Future research could extend these findings by exploring the full spectrum of disease domains, thereby broadening the impact of our framework.


Our study assumes that gene modules with coordinated expression patterns will also exhibit coordinated pathological effects.
This work integrates two complementary approaches to explore this hypothesis.
Firstly, we employed MultiPLIER, which extracts latent variables (LVs) from large expression datasets.
These LVs may represent real transcriptional processes or technical factors, such as batch effects.
We utilized a model from recount2, initially designed for rare disorders, which may not be optimal for the diverse range of complex diseases in our study.
Additionally, the linear factorization method of MultiPLIER might overlook complex co-expression patterns.
Moreover, recount2 has been surpassed by larger datasets [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1101/2021.05.21.445138].
However, our models impose minimal assumptions on the latent expression representation, allowing for the potential replacement of MultiPLIER with other methods like GenomicSuperSignature [@doi:10.1038/s41467-022-31411-3].
Secondly, we utilized TWAS, focusing on the hypothesis that GWAS loci affect traits via gene expression changes.
This approach does not capture other effects, such as coding variants disrupting protein-protein interactions, and has limitations that may lead to false positives [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2020.11.012].
Similar to GWAS, TWAS often identifies multiple genes within the same locus due to shared GWAS variants, correlated expression of nearby genes, or eQTLs in linkage disequilibrium [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0092-1; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367; @doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0385-z].
Despite these challenges, our LV-based regression framework effectively accounts for gene-gene correlations in TWAS, providing a robust analysis of gene expression's role in complex diseases.
Future research could further refine these methods and explore additional factors influencing gene expression and disease pathology.


### Revised Paragraph

Our findings align with previous research indicating that drugs supported by genetic evidence are more likely to progress successfully through the drug development pipeline [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
By utilizing latent variables to project association results, we achieved better prioritization of disease-treatment pairs compared to analyses focusing solely on single-gene effects.
This approach also offers the advantage of generating interpretable genetic features, which can be scrutinized to infer potential mechanisms of action.
However, a notable challenge in our method is the selection of the most suitable tissue model from TWAS to identify reversed transcriptome patterns between genes and drug-induced perturbations, especially when prioritizing drugs for diseases with diverse tissue etiologies.
Future research should aim to refine tissue model selection to enhance the robustness and applicability of this approach across various disease contexts.


Ultimately, the quality of the representations is essential to performance.
In this study, we utilized a representation derived from the factorization of bulk RNA-seq data, which, while effective, could be further enhanced.
Detailed perturbation datasets and single-cell profiling of tissues, both with and without perturbagens, and at various developmental stages, offer a promising avenue for generating higher quality and more interpretable representations.
The key to achieving this interpretability lies in the annotation of sample metadata.
Emerging methods for inferring and annotating structured metadata show great promise and can be directly applied to existing datasets [@doi:10.1101/2021.05.10.443525].
Rapid advancements in both representation quality and metadata annotation pave the way for the widespread application of latent variable projections, which can help unravel the genetic basis of complex human phenotypes.
By providing a novel perspective for understanding statistical associations from Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS), our method can generate testable hypotheses for post-GWAS functional characterization of complex diseases.
This is likely to be a significant area of research in the coming years.
