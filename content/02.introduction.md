## Introduction

Genes operate within specific networks to perform various functions [@pmid:19104045; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Variations in these genes can alter their roles, impacting disease-related biological processes [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06022-6].
Understanding how genes influence complex traits necessitates a mechanistic insight into gene expression regulation across different cell types [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3; @doi:10.1038/s41576-019-0200-9], which could lead to better treatments [@doi:10.1038/ng.3314; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1008489].
Previous research has identified various regulatory DNA elements [@doi:10.1038/nature11247; @doi:10.1038/nature14248; @doi:10.1038/nature12787; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-03145-z; @doi:10.1038/s41586-020-2559-3] and genetic effects on gene expression across tissues [@doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776].
Integrating functional genomics and GWAS data [@doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2018.04.002; @doi:10.1038/s41588-018-0081-4; @doi:10.1038/ncomms6890] has enhanced the identification of transcriptional mechanisms, which, when dysregulated, often result in tissue- and cell lineage-specific diseases [@pmid:20624743; @pmid:14707169; @doi:10.1073/pnas.0810772105].
However, the precise ways these mechanisms contribute to pathology remain unclear, necessitating further investigation.


### Revised Paragraph:

The availability of gene expression data across various tissues [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838; @doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6; @doi:10.1126/science.aaz1776; @doi:10.1186/s13040-020-00216-9] has paved the way for advanced analytical techniques.
One such method is the transcription-wide association study (TWAS), which integrates expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) data to provide a mechanistic understanding of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings.
TWAS tests whether changes in gene regulatory mechanisms mediate the link between genetic variants and human diseases [@doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1009482; @doi:10.1038/ng.3506; @doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1007889; @doi:10.1038/ng.3367].
This approach has proven highly effective in elucidating disease etiology at the transcriptome level [@pmid:33931583; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225; @pmid:31036433], predicting disease risk through polygenic scores [@doi:10.1186/s13059-021-02591-w], and identifying potential drug repurposing opportunities [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
Despite these successes, TWAS operates at the individual gene level, failing to capture more complex interactions at the network level.
This limitation underscores the need for approaches that can analyze gene interactions within broader biological networks.


### Revised Paragraph

Understanding gene-gene interactions is vital for deciphering the architecture of complex traits, as emphasized by the omnigenic model [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038].
This model posits that to unravel disease mechanisms, methods must account for the intricate interplay among genes.
Gene pleiotropy illustrates the interconnectedness of transcriptional networks, suggesting that nearly all genes expressed in disease-relevant cell types influence the trait [@doi:10.1038/s41588-019-0481-0; @doi:10.1038/ng.3570; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038; @doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014].
One approach to studying these interactions is through gene modules, which are groups of genes with similar expression profiles across various conditions [@pmid:22955619; @pmid:25344726; @doi:10.1038/ng.3259].
Several unsupervised methods have been developed to infer gene-gene connections by identifying these modules from co-expression patterns [@pmid:9843981; @pmid:24662387; @pmid:16333293].
Techniques like independent component analysis (ICA) and principal component analysis (PCA) excel in this task because they capture local expression effects and manage overlapping modules effectively [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03424-4].
Therefore, integrating genetic studies with gene modules derived from unsupervised learning could enhance our understanding of disease origins [@pmid:25344726] and progression [@pmid:18631455].


**Revised paragraph:**

Understanding the genetic basis of complex traits requires innovative approaches.
PhenoPLIER offers an omnigenic framework that views genetic studies through the lens of gene modules.
This method integrates various data modalities for joint analysis, allowing for the inference of how groups of functionally-related genes influence complex traits, the detection of shared and distinct transcriptomic properties among traits, and the prediction of pharmacological perturbations on gene activity.
PhenoPLIER achieves this by mapping gene-trait associations and drug-induced transcriptional responses into a common latent representation.
Specifically, it integrates thousands of gene-trait associations from PhenomeXcan [@doi:10.1126/sciadv.aba2083] and transcriptional profiles of drugs from LINCS L1000 [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049] into a low-dimensional space derived from public gene expression data on tens of thousands of RNA-seq samples (recount2 [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003; @doi:10.1038/nbt.3838]).
Using a matrix factorization approach [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1; @doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], PhenoPLIER extracts gene modules that align with prior knowledge, such as pathways.
When mapping gene-trait associations to this reduced expression space, significant associations are observed, such as hypothyroidism with T cells and neuropsychiatric disorders with different brain cell types.
The method's flexibility also allows the identification of modules associated with cell types under specific stimuli or disease states.
Notably, significant module-trait associations in PhenomeXcan replicated in the eMERGE network phase III [@doi:10.1038/gim.2013.72; @doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225].
Further, a CRISPR screen analyzing lipid regulation in HepG2 cells showed more robust trait associations with modules than individual genes, even when known lipid metabolism genes did not reach genome-wide significance.
Compared to single-gene approaches, PhenoPLIER better predicts FDA-approved drug-disease links by capturing tissue-specific pathophysiological mechanisms, such as niacin's cardiovascular effects via immune mechanisms.
This improved prediction suggests that modules may offer a superior means of examining drug-disease relationships.
Finally, exploring the phenotype-module space reveals stable trait clusters associated with relevant tissues, including a complex branch involving lipids with cardiovascular, autoimmune, and neuropsychiatric disorders.
In summary, PhenoPLIER shifts the focus from single genes to groups of genes acting together in specific cell types, enhancing the robustness of genetic association detection and interpretation.
This approach prioritizes promising candidate targets and provides mechanistic insights from statistical associations, potentially advancing our understanding of complex diseases and their therapeutic interventions.
