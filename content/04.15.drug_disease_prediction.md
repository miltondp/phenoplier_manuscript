### LVs predict drug-disease pairs better than single genes

We next tested whether substituting latent variables (LVs) for individual genes could accurately predict known treatment-disease relationships.
To do this, we utilized transcriptional responses to small molecule perturbations from the LINCS L1000 dataset [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049], which were aligned with DrugBank identifiers [@doi:10.1093/nar/gkt1068; @doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47223].
Employing a drug repurposing strategy that identifies reversed transcriptome patterns between diseases and drug-induced changes [@doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3002648; @doi:10.1126/scitranslmed.3001318], we used a framework that integrates imputed transcriptomes from transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) to prioritize drug candidates [@doi:10.1038/nn.4618].
This involved calculating a drug-disease score by computing the negative dot product of the $z$-scores for a disease (from TWAS) and the $z$-scores for a drug (from LINCS) across various gene sets (see [Methods](#sec:methods:drug)).
A high score indicated a potential therapeutic effect, as it suggested that drugs could counteract the expression patterns of disease-associated genes.
Additionally, using an LV-based approach, we assessed how drug perturbations influenced gene module activities by projecting drug expression profiles onto our latent variable framework (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b).
The efficacy of these predictions was validated against a manually-curated gold standard of medical indications for 322 drugs across 53 diseases [@doi:10.7554/eLife.26726; @doi:10.5281/zenodo.47664].
This systematic approach confirmed that our LV-based model effectively predicts drug-disease relationships, demonstrating its potential utility in identifying new therapeutic opportunities.

To assess whether the latent space of gene-trait associations and drug-induced expression profiles effectively captures biologically meaningful patterns, we compared the performance of latent variable (LV)-based methods to traditional gene-based methods.
Despite the inherent information loss in projecting complex data into a lower-dimensional space, the LV-based approach demonstrated superior predictive capabilities.
Specifically, it achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.632 and an average precision (AP) of 0.858, as illustrated in Figure @fig:drug_disease:roc_pr.
These prediction results indicate that the reduced dimensionality of the latent space retains critical information, effectively linking pathophysiological processes with the mechanisms of action of drugs.
Thus, even with the compression of data, the LV-based method remains a robust tool for uncovering significant biological insights.


To assess the biological plausibility of latent variables (LVs) in predicting drug-disease relationships, we focused on the interaction between nicotinic acid (niacin) and lipid disorders.
Niacin, a B vitamin used clinically to manage lipid levels, has debated effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular disease, despite its known mechanisms on lipid metabolism [@pmid:22085343; @pmid:25014686; @pmid:30977858].
It functions by inhibiting key pathways in lipid catabolism, notably increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) via liver receptors and reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) production by affecting triglyceride synthesis in hepatocytes and adipocytes [@doi:10.1016/j.amjcard.2008.02.029; @doi:10.1194/jlr.S092007; @pmid:24363242; @pmid:24713591].
In our study, niacin was correctly identified by both gene-based and LV-based models as a therapeutic agent for coronary artery disease (CAD) with significant prediction scores (0.51 and 0.96, respectively), and for atherosclerosis (AT), where the LV-based model gave a positive score (0.52) in contrast to the gene-based model's negative score (-0.01).
LV246, which is highly expressed in adipose tissue and liver and linked to plasma lipids and high cholesterol, emerged as a key contributor in these predictions.
It ranked as the 16th most influential module for AT and was also significant in other cardiovascular conditions, highlighting its relevance across related diseases (Figure @fig:lv246; Table @tbl:sup:phenomexcan_assocs:lv246).
This analysis confirms that the LVs driving the predictions for niacin's therapeutic use in lipid-related cardiovascular diseases are indeed biologically plausible, supporting the utility of this predictive approach.

To understand the diverse roles of niacin in combating cardiovascular diseases, we investigated its mechanisms of action beyond the well-known lipid-regulating effects.
The high-affinity niacin receptor *GPR109A/HCAR2*, which is expressed in various immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, plays a crucial role in these mechanisms [@doi:10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.008; @doi:10.1038/sj.jid.5700586].
Initially, niacin's antiatherogenic properties were attributed primarily to its ability to inhibit lipolysis in adipose tissue.
However, recent findings indicate that niacin also mitigates atherosclerosis progression through its activation of *GPR109A* in immune cells, thereby enhancing anti-inflammatory responses independently of its lipid-lowering effects [@doi:10.1172/JCI41651; @doi:10.1161/ATVBAHA.108.179283].
Additionally, the activation of *GPR109A* in Langerhans cells, which are skin macrophages, leads to the common side effect of flushing associated with niacin use.
The expression profiles of genes within the top niacin-contributing modules, such as LV116 and LV931, reveal their significant presence in these immune cells, suggesting alternative pathways through which niacin exerts its effects (Figures @fig:lv116:cell_types and @fig:sup:lv931, and Tables @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv116 and @tbl:sup:multiplier_pathways:lv931).
These modules also respond to various stimuli, including infections and autoimmune diseases, highlighting their broad immunological roles [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0192082; @doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0109760; @doi:10.1126/science.aac7442; @url:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA258384; @doi:10.3390/v5071664; @doi:10.1038/srep16882].
This analysis confirms that niacin's beneficial effects in cardiovascular health extend beyond lipid regulation, involving complex interactions within the immune system facilitated by *GPR109A*.

To further explore the biological effects of niacin beyond its known cardiovascular benefits, we investigated whether niacin influences other latent variables (LVs) that could elucidate additional mechanisms of action.
Specifically, we focused on LV66, which emerged as one of the top LVs impacted by niacin treatment, as shown in Figure @fig:sup:lv66.
This LV was predominantly expressed in ovarian granulosa cells.
Recent studies have highlighted the potential of niacin as a therapeutic agent for ovarian disorders.
It has been demonstrated that niacin promotes follicle growth and inhibits apoptosis in granulosa cells within animal models [@doi:10.1159/000495051; @doi:10.1071/RD20306].
Thus, our findings suggest that niacin may have beneficial effects in the treatment of ovarian diseases by modulating the activity of specific LVs such as LV66.
