### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

Understanding the genetic underpinnings of lipid regulation is crucial for developing targeted therapies for lipid-associated disorders.
However, the identification of specific genes within disease-relevant loci that can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit remains poorly explored.
Addressing this gap, our study investigates the potential of genes within a lipid-associated locus (LV) to serve as therapeutic targets.
We employed a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 screen in the HepG2 cell line to identify genes implicated in lipid regulation, resulting in the discovery of 462 genes.
Subsequently, we focused on two subsets of these genes that either increased or decreased lipid levels.
The lipid-decreasing set included eight genes: *BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*; the lipid-increasing set comprised six genes: *ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*.
Our findings suggest that manipulating these specific genes could influence lipid metabolism, thereby offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention in metabolic diseases.
This study not only fills a critical gap by identifying targetable genes within a key locus but also advances our understanding of the genetic basis of lipid regulation, potentially guiding future therapeutic strategies.

In the burgeoning field of lipidomics, understanding the genetic underpinnings of lipid metabolism disorders remains a significant challenge, particularly in linking specific gene expressions with clinical lipid traits.
Despite advances in genomic technologies, a gap persists in effectively predicting disease associations from gene expression profiles in diverse tissues.
Here, we address this gap by employing a novel approach using Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) to analyze 987 latent variables (LVs) derived from large-scale gene expression data.
Our analysis identified 15 LVs that were significantly enriched with lipid-altering gene sets, with LV246 showing the strongest association with lipid increase, primarily expressed in adipose tissue.
Further, using a regression framework across all traits in PhenomeXcan, we demonstrated that gene weights for LV246 are predictive of associations for plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease, findings that were robustly replicated across 309 traits in eMERGE, including significant associations with hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and other lipid metabolism disorders.
These results not only fill a crucial gap by linking adipose tissue gene expressions to specific lipid traits and diseases but also advance our understanding of the genetic basis of lipid metabolism, potentially guiding targeted therapies and interventions in lipid-related disorders.


Despite advancements in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) for identifying genes associated with cardiovascular traits, certain genes with potential biological importance remain overlooked.
Specifically, the high-confidence genes *DGAT2* and *ACACA*, identified through our CRISPR screening, encode enzymes critical for triglycerides and fatty acid synthesis but were not prioritized by TWAS due to their lack of association with cardiovascular traits.
This discrepancy suggests a gap in our understanding of gene-trait associations, potentially overlooking key biological contributors.
To address this, we employed a novel analytical approach integrating CRISPR screening results with TWAS to investigate the roles of *DGAT2* and *ACACA* in lipid metabolism.
Our findings reveal that, unlike other genes in the same locus (LV246), *DGAT2* and *ACACA* do not colocalize with cardiovascular traits but are essential "core" genes directly influencing lipid-related traits without mediated regulation.
This study challenges the existing paradigms of gene prioritization in TWAS, highlighting the importance of integrating diverse genomic approaches to uncover the full spectrum of genes influencing complex traits.
By revealing the direct impact of *DGAT2* and *ACACA* on lipid metabolism, our research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of genetic determinants in cardiovascular health, potentially guiding more targeted therapeutic strategies.
