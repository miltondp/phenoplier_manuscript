### LVs link genes that alter lipid accumulation with relevant traits and tissues

Lipid regulation is crucial in understanding and treating various metabolic diseases, yet the identification of specific genes that could serve as therapeutic targets remains incomplete.
Current literature lacks comprehensive insights into genes linked to lipid regulation and their potential as targets for therapeutic intervention.
To address this gap, we conducted a fluorescence-based CRISPR-Cas9 screen in the HepG2 cell line to identify genes associated with lipid regulation, resulting in the identification of 462 relevant genes.
From this pool, we curated two high-confidence gene sets: one comprising eight genes (*BLCAP*, *FBXW7*, *INSIG2*, *PCYT2*, *PTEN*, *SOX9*, *TCF7L2*, *UBE2J2*) associated with lipid decrease, and another with six genes (*ACACA*, *DGAT2*, *HILPDA*, *MBTPS1*, *SCAP*, *SRPR*) linked to lipid increase.
These findings suggest that specific genes play significant roles in lipid regulation and could be promising targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at metabolic diseases, thereby advancing our understanding and treatment of these conditions.

Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, yet the genetic underpinnings that regulate lipid levels remain incompletely understood.
Current literature lacks comprehensive analyses that integrate gene expression data with lipid-related traits to identify key genetic drivers.
Here, we employed Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (FGSEA) on 987 latent variables (LVs) to uncover associations with lipid-altering gene sets, identifying 15 LVs with nominal enrichment (unadjusted *P* < 0.01).
Notably, LV246, the top LV linked to the lipids-increasing gene set, predominantly comprised genes co-expressed in adipose tissue, a critical regulator of lipid metabolism.
Utilizing a regression framework across PhenomeXcan traits, we demonstrated that gene weights for LV246 predicted associations with plasma lipids, high cholesterol, and Alzheimer's disease (FDR < 1e-23).
These associations were further validated in the eMERGE dataset, where LV246 showed significant links to hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, and lipoid metabolism disorders (FDR < 4e-9).
Our findings elucidate the genetic architecture of lipid regulation and highlight LV246 as a pivotal factor, advancing our understanding of lipid metabolism and its related disorders.


In the field of genomics, identifying genes that contribute to complex traits, such as cardiovascular diseases, remains a significant challenge.
Traditional Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) often prioritize genes based on their association with specific traits, potentially overlooking crucial genes that do not show immediate associations.
This study aims to address this gap by utilizing CRISPR screening to identify high-confidence genes involved in triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, which may not be prioritized by TWAS alone.
Here, we identified *DGAT2* and *ACACA* as high-confidence genes through CRISPR screening, which encode enzymes critical for triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis.
These genes were among the highest-weighted in our LV246 analysis but were not associated or colocalized with cardiovascular-related traits, unlike other members such as *SCD*, *LPL*, *FADS2*, *HMGCR*, and *LDLR*.
This discrepancy may be explained by the omnigenic model, suggesting that *DGAT2* and *ACACA* might be core genes directly affecting the trait without mediated regulation, while other genes in the LV246 are peripheral, trans-regulating these core genes.
These findings highlight the importance of integrating CRISPR screening with TWAS to uncover genes that play a direct role in complex traits, advancing our understanding of the genetic architecture underlying cardiovascular diseases.
