## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Understanding how genes interact within specific contexts to influence complex traits is essential for advancing therapeutic development.
Current research highlights the importance of mechanistic insights into gene expression regulation across various conditions.
While transcriptome-wide association studies have shed light on individual gene roles in disease mechanisms, the intricate architecture of complex traits suggests that gene-gene interactions are pivotal in disease onset and progression.
To address this gap, we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that integrates gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a unified latent representation.
This representation is organized into modules of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns under identical conditions.
Our findings demonstrate that diseases are significantly linked with gene modules active in relevant cell types, and PhenoPLIER excels in predicting known drug-disease pairs and elucidating mechanisms of action.
Additionally, a CRISPR screen focusing on lipid regulation reveals that key functional players, although not individually associated, are prioritized within trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER.
By leveraging groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER offers a contextualized view of genetic associations, uncovering potential therapeutic targets overlooked by single-gene approaches.
This advancement holds promise for more precise and effective treatments.
