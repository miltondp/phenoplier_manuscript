## Abstract {.page_break_before}

In the field of genomics, understanding the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression across various conditions is pivotal for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits and developing targeted therapies.
While transcriptome-wide association studies have advanced our knowledge by identifying individual genes associated with disease mechanisms, they often overlook the critical role of gene-gene interactions.
These interactions are increasingly recognized as fundamental in the etiology and progression of complex diseases.
To address this gap, here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a novel computational framework that leverages both gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data, integrating them into a unified latent representation.
This model is based on modules of co-expressed genes, facilitating the analysis under consistent conditions.
Our findings demonstrate that disease traits significantly correlate with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types.
PhenoPLIER not only accurately predicts known drug-disease relationships but also infers mechanisms of action.
Additionally, our use of CRISPR screening for lipid regulation highlights that while some functionally important genes may lack direct associations, they are effectively prioritized within trait-associated modules.
By incorporating co-expression patterns, PhenoPLIER enhances our ability to contextualize genetic data and identify potential therapeutic targets that are not apparent through single-gene analysis approaches, thereby offering a more comprehensive understanding of gene regulation in disease.
