### PhenoPLIER: an integration framework based on gene co-expression patterns

![
**Schematic of the PhenoPLIER framework.**
**a)** High-level schematic of PhenoPLIER (a gene module-based method) in the context of TWAS (single-gene) and GWAS (single-variant).
In GWAS, we identify variants associated with traits.
In TWAS, first, we identify variants that are associated with gene expression levels (eQTLs); then, prediction models based on eQTLs are used to impute gene expression, which is used to compute gene-trait associations.
Resources such as LINCS L1000 provide information about how a drug perturbs gene expression; at the bottom-right corner, we show how a drug downregulates two genes (A and C).
In PhenoPLIER, these data types are integrated using groups of genes co-expressed across one or more conditions (such as cell types) that we call gene modules or latent variables/LVs. Created with BioRender.com.
**b)** The integration process in PhenoPLIER uses low-dimensional representations (matrices $\mathbf{Z}$ and $\mathbf{B}$) learned from large gene expression datasets (top).
We used gene-drug information $\mathbf{L}$ from LINCS L1000 and gene-trait associations $\mathbf{M}$ from TWAS: PhenomeXcan was used as the discovery cohort, and eMERGE as replication (middle).
PhenoPLIER provides three computational components (bottom):
1) an LV-based regression model that associates an LV $j$ ($\mathbf{Z}_j$) with a trait $i$ ($\mathbf{M}_i$),
2) a clustering framework that learns groups of traits from TWAS associations projected into the LV space ($\hat{\mathbf{M}}$),
and 3) an LV-based drug repurposing approach that uses the projection of TWAS ($\hat{\mathbf{M}}$) and LINCS L1000 ($\hat{\mathbf{L}}$) into the LV space.
**c)** Genes that are part of LV603, termed as a neutrophil signature [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], were expressed in relevant cell types (top), with 53 independent samples expressed in Neutrophils, 59 in Granulocytes, and 20 in Whole blood, 56 in PBMC, 8 in mDCs, 29 in Monocytes, and 5 in Epithelial cells (the boxplot shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles while the whiskers extend to the minimum/maximum values).
LV603 was associated in PhenoPLIER with neutrophil counts and other white blood cells (bottom, showing the top 10 traits for LV603 after projecting gene-trait associations in PhenomeXcan).

To assess the efficacy and versatility of PhenoPLIER, a computational framework designed for integrated analysis of gene expressions and their associations with traits and drugs, we explored its three primary components.
PhenoPLIER combines gene-trait and gene-drug associations with gene modules that are contextually expressed, as illustrated in Figure {@fig:entire_process}a.
It employs a latent representation, where latent variables (LVs) represent gene modules derived from a substantial gene expression compendium (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, top).
This framework integrates transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) with drug-induced transcriptional responses for a comprehensive analysis (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, middle).
The three main components of PhenoPLIER include: 1) an LV-based regression model to determine associations between an LV and a trait, 2) a clustering framework to identify groups of traits with shared transcriptomic properties, and 3) an LV-based drug repurposing approach linking diseases to potential treatments (Figure {@fig:entire_process}b, bottom, see [Methods](#sec:methods)).
To validate the accuracy and reliability of these components, we conducted extensive simulations for both the regression model ([Supplementary Note 1](#sm:reg:null_sim)) and the clustering framework ([Supplementary Note 2](#sm:clustering:null_sim)), ensuring they were well-calibrated and performed as expected in scenarios with no underlying association.
The results confirm that PhenoPLIER is a robust tool capable of effectively linking gene expressions to relevant biological traits and potential therapeutic interventions.


To assess the robustness and applicability of gene-trait associations, we utilized the TWAS results from two different sources: PhenomeXcan and the eMERGE network, serving as discovery and replication cohorts respectively.
PhenomeXcan, which sources data from the UK Biobank and other studies, provided associations for 4,091 diseases and traits ([@doi:10.1038/s41586-018-0579-z]), while the eMERGE network analyses covered 309 phecodes ([@doi:10.1101/2021.10.21.21265225]).
Our methodology, detailed in the [Methods](#sec:methods:twas) and [Methods](#sec:methods:predixcan) sections, employed two statistical approaches: Summary-MultiXcan (S-MultiXcan) for regression and clustering, and Summary-PrediXcan (S-PrediXcan) for exploring drug repurposing possibilities.
Additionally, we incorporated colocalization analyses to estimate the overlap between GWAS and eQTL signals, enhancing the reliability of our findings.
For the drug repurposing component, we analyzed transcriptional responses to 1,170 small molecule perturbations from the LINCS L1000 dataset ([@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.10.049]).
These comprehensive analyses confirm the validity and potential utility of the identified gene-trait associations for both replication and novel therapeutic discovery.


To understand the robustness and specificity of the latent gene expression profiles, we investigated whether the MultiPLIER models could effectively summarize complex gene expression data.
These models, as detailed in our Methods section ([Methods](#sec:methods:multiplier)), utilize a matrix factorization technique known as PLIER [@doi:10.1038/s41592-019-0456-1] to analyze data from recount2 [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3838].
Recount2 is a comprehensive resource that provides transcript-level gene expression quantification across a wide array of samples, encompassing various diseases, cell types, differentiation stages, and stimuli.
By applying the MultiPLIER approach, which is documented in [@doi:10.1016/j.cels.2019.04.003], we derived latent variables (LVs).
The extraction of 987 LVs was not only aimed at optimal data reconstruction but also at ensuring alignment with established biological pathways and prior knowledge.
This dual optimization confirms that the MultiPLIER models are effective in capturing meaningful biological information from complex datasets.


To determine whether latent variables (LVs) could offer insights into the transcriptional mechanisms underlying complex traits, we explored the utility of projecting transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and pharmacologic perturbations data into a latent space defined by LVs.
Each LV, representing a group of weighted genes expressed together in specific tissues and cell types, potentially encapsulates a functional set of genes regulated by a common transcriptional program [@doi:10.1186/1471-2164-7-187; @doi:10.1186/s13059-019-1835-8].
Using the PhenoPLIER methodology, we transformed gene associations into an LV score by multiplying all genes' standardized effect sizes (from TWAS) or differential expression values (from pharmacologic perturbation data) by the LV genes' weights and summing them, producing a single value that links traits and drugs to functionally-related gene groups or LVs.
This approach benefits from LV annotations detailing the specific conditions of gene expression, such as cell types, tissues, and various developmental or disease stages, enhancing result interpretability.
Notably, in the original MultiPLIER study, LV603 was identified as associated with a known neutrophil pathway and correlated with neutrophil count estimates from RNA-seq profiles [@doi:10.1186/s13059-016-1070-5].
Our analysis confirmed that neutrophil counts and other white blood cell traits were highly ranked among 4,091 traits analyzed, and both basophil count and percentage were significantly associated with LV603.
These findings support the hypothesis that projecting diverse data modalities into the latent space where LVs represent functionally coherent gene groups can effectively link transcriptional mechanisms to complex traits.


To assess the capabilities of PhenoPLIER in exploring gene-disease relationships, several key questions were posed: Do disease-associated genes cluster within specific modules that are expressed in particular tissues or cell types? Are these modules, tied to specific cell types, linked to various diseases, potentially exemplifying "network pleiotropy" from an omnigenic perspective [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.05.038]? Additionally, does PhenoPLIER identify a subset of genes within these modules that align more closely with the concept of "core" genes, which directly influence traits without the mediation of other genes [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2019.04.014], thereby offering more promising targets for therapeutic intervention? Lastly, can PhenoPLIER suggest potential mechanisms of action for drugs that affect these transcriptional mechanisms? The analysis confirmed that PhenoPLIER effectively identifies tissue and cell type-specific modules associated with multiple diseases, supports the identification of core gene subsets, and provides insights into the transcriptional mechanisms potentially targeted by drugs, thereby affirming its utility in advancing our understanding of gene-disease associations and therapeutic opportunities.
